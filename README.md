# 🧠 AI for Full Stack Developers

A hands-on, structured blog series and code repository designed to help full stack developers become **AI-capable engineers**.

This project covers everything from foundational AI concepts to deploying production-grade **GenAI** and **agentic systems**—without requiring a PhD in machine learning.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

This repository includes:
- ✍️ **Blog articles** (in Markdown)
- 📒 **Colab-ready Jupyter Notebooks**
- 📊 **Visual diagrams** (Medium-light style)
- 🧱 **Project scaffolds** for building and deploying ML & GenAI applications
